Completeness:
    All final project objectives fulfilled. 
    Types of objects in the final composition:
        Rigid boxes, a cylinder, and spheres
        Two strings of spheres joined by hinged joints
        
Directions on how to run:
    This is going to be roughly my final project submission, where I also had to include the tiff file library source and my TETMESH objects. Hence the large size.
    The solution can be run from VS 2012 desktop express, on Debug Win32 settings.
    Additional library directories as well as include directories will need to be updated manually to match your machine, I did not use the system variable method.
